# Yu-AAWOWC
Anti-AFK WoW Classic (Chinese Server)

Not becaue I wanted to create this, it was made because the server in china right now are so bad with queues, As a forigner it can be near impossible to play the game at any given time.
This program does nothing more but push a key on your keyboard.

I cant gurantee you wont get banned, but should be fine.

Contains background notify, So you can easily see it running, Customizable timer for pushing button on keybaord, remains in foreground when set to on.
